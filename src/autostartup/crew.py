        # Define tasks with callbacks that update progress
        # CrewAI task callbacks are typically for post-execution.
        # To update progress *before* a task starts, we'd ideally need a feature
        # in CrewAI like `task.on_start(callback_fn)`.
        # Lacking that, we'll have to modify how tasks are kicked off if possible,
        # or call the progress update just before `crew.kickoff` for the first task,
        # and then rely on task completion for subsequent updates (which isn't ideal for live progress).

        # The current structure of CrewAI (v0.28.8 and similar) using @task and @agent
        # primarily configures the crew structure at class definition time.
        # For runtime modifications like adding dynamic callbacks that depend on instance variables (job_id),
        # it's often cleaner to construct tasks and agents directly within the @crew method
        # or pass necessary data through task inputs if the framework supports it.

        # Let's try a different approach:
        # We will override the kickoff method of the Crew or individual tasks if possible,
        # or more simply, call the update method from within the TaskManager *around* the `crew.kickoff()` call.

        # For now, let's focus on what we can do within this file.
        # The `Task` object has a `callback` parameter in its constructor.
        # This callback is executed *after* the task is done.
        # To update progress *before* each task, we need to modify the `TaskManager._run_crew_analysis`
        # to call `_track_task_progress` before each task is handed to an agent.
        # This is not possible with `crew.kickoff()` which runs the whole sequence.

        # A practical way to handle this without deep CrewAI modification is to make the tasks
        # themselves call the progress update as their very first action.
        # This means the `execute` method of a custom tool or the beginning of a task's defined action.
        # This is more invasive.

        # Let's reconsider the plan:
        # The TaskManager will call `_track_task_progress` just before `crew.kickoff()`. This sets the first task.
        # For subsequent tasks, we need a way for the crew to signal back.
        # CrewAI's hierarchical process with a manager agent might offer a way.
        # The manager agent could be given a tool to report progress.

        # Simpler approach: The `TaskManager` will iterate through tasks. This is a significant change.
        # The original code runs `crew.kickoff()` and lets it manage the sequence.

        # Let's stick to the plan of modifying `TaskManager` to call `_track_task_progress`
        # more frequently. This file, `crew.py`, might not need `task_manager` and `job_id`
        # if `TaskManager` handles the orchestration of progress updates between tasks.

        # The original plan was:
        # 1. Autostartup gets task_manager, job_id.
        # 2. Before each task's execution, call task_manager.update_task_progress.

        # If `crew.kickoff()` is a black box for the sequence, we can't intercept between tasks
        # from *outside* the crew. We need to do it from *inside*.
        # This implies tasks themselves need to be aware of the progress update mechanism.

        # Let's assume tasks can take `task_manager` and `job_id` as context or parameters.
        # The `Task` constructor has a `context` parameter.

        # New approach for this step:
        # - The `Autostartup` class's `crew` method will instantiate tasks and provide them
        #   with a callback function. This callback will be linked to the `task_manager`.
        # - The `task_manager` and `job_id` will be passed to `Autostartup` when it's instantiated.
