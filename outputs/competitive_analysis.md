## 2. Expedia

Expedia is another major online travel company offering a comprehensive suite of travel booking services, including flights, hotels, car rentals, and vacation packages.

### Strengths:

## 3. Agoda

Agoda, part of Booking Holdings, is particularly strong in the Asian market and is known for its competitive pricing and extensive range of accommodations.

### Weaknesses:

*   **Potential for High Turnover:** Anecdotal evidence suggests potential issues with employee turnover, which could indirectly impact service consistency.
