Your final answer must be a single, clean JSON object and NOTHING ELSE. Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown code block formatting around the JSON. The JSON object MUST have three top-level keys: 'repo_name', 'description', and 'files'. - 'repo_name' should be a suitable, slug-cased name for the project. - 'description' should be a brief, one-sentence project description. - 'files' must be a list of objects, where each object has a 'path' (e.g., "src/main.py")
  and 'content' (initial placeholder code or text).
- One of the files MUST be a 'README.md' containing the detailed technical plan.
