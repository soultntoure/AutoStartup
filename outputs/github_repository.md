# CampusGigs MVP

CampusGigs is a mobile app that connects university students with part-time gigs near campus. Our mission is to provide students with a simple and efficient way to find flexible work that fits their busy schedules, while helping local businesses find reliable, temporary help.

This repository contains the source code for the CampusGigs mobile application (React Native) and the backend API (Node.js/Express).

## ‚ú® Key MVP Features

- **Student & Employer Accounts:** Separate registration and profile management for students and businesses.
- **Gig Postings:** Employers can post gigs with details like title, description, pay, location, and time.
- **Hyper-Local Gig Feed:** Students see a feed of available gigs, prioritized by proximity to their campus.
- **Geo-Location Search:** A map view to visually search for gigs nearby.
- **Simple Applications:** Students can apply for gigs with a single tap.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Monorepo:** PNPM Workspaces
- **Mobile App:** React Native (Expo) & TypeScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with PostGIS
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Authentication:** JWT

## üìÇ Repository Structure

This project is a monorepo managed by `pnpm`. The code is organized into two main packages:

- `packages/app`: The React Native (Expo) mobile application.
- `packages/server`: The Node.js backend server.

Shared configurations like `tsconfig.base.json` are located in the root directory.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) (for running PostgreSQL)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/campus-gigs-mvp.git
    cd campus-gigs-mvp
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies from the root directory:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up the database:**
    -   Start a PostgreSQL instance using Docker. This command also sets up the PostGIS extension.
        ```bash
        docker run --name campus-gigs-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgis/postgis
        ```

4.  **Configure environment variables for the server:**
    -   Navigate to the server package: `cd packages/server`
    -   Copy the example environment file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    -   Update the `.env` file with your database connection string and a secure JWT secret:
        ```
        DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost:5432/postgres?schema=public"
        JWT_SECRET="YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY"
        ```

5.  **Run database migrations:**
    -   From the `packages/server` directory, apply the Prisma schema to your database:
        ```bash
        pnpm prisma migrate dev --name init
        ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the App

You will need two separate terminal windows to run the backend and frontend concurrently.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    -   From the root directory, run:
        ```bash
        pnpm --filter server dev
        ```
    -   The server will be running on `http://localhost:4000`.

2.  **Start the Mobile App:**
    -   In a new terminal, from the root directory, run:
        ```bash
        pnpm --filter app start
        ```
    -   This will start the Expo development server. You can then run the app on an iOS simulator, Android emulator, or on your physical device using the Expo Go app.
