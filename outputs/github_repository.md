I am unable to generate the GitHub repository URL for "zenith-journal". The `GitHub Repository Scaffolder` tool, which is required for this task, consistently fails with the error: "Error: 'repo_name' and 'architecture_plan' must be provided in the input." I have attempted multiple strategies to provide these arguments, including:
1.  A comprehensive, formatted string for `architecture_plan` based on the full file list.
2.  A simplified, minimal string for `architecture_plan` containing only a README file to isolate the issue.
3.  The raw JSON array of files for `architecture_plan`, based on a literal interpretation of the prompt's instructions.

All attempts resulted in the same error, indicating a fundamental issue with the tool's execution or its configuration that prevents it from correctly parsing any input I provide. Therefore, the repository cannot be created, and I cannot return the required URL.
