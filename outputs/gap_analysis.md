The project blueprint for the fitness class booking app, "An app that helps people find and book local fitness classes easily," is as follows:

**1. Project Vision & User Idea:**
To create an app that helps people find and book local fitness classes easily, focusing on transparency, user experience, and supporting niche fitness studios.

**2. Market Analysis & Identified Gap:**
*   **Competitor Landscape:**
    *   **ClassPass:** Offers variety and flexibility but suffers from limited availability, subscription costs, and potential negative studio/user perceptions.
    *   **Mindbody:** A robust business management tool but has a complex, dated user interface and integration challenges, making user discovery cumbersome.
    *   **WellnessLiving:** Provides business solutions but faces issues with scheduling reliability and may lack depth in fitness-specific tools for certain niches.
*   **Identified Market Gap:** A significant gap exists for a platform that offers transparent, per-class value, a seamless and intuitive user experience for discovery and booking, and actively supports niche and boutique fitness studios. Casual fitness enthusiasts are underserved by existing subscription models and complex interfaces.

**3. Core Value Proposition:**
To provide a transparent, user-friendly platform that connects individuals with local fitness classes based on genuine interest and availability, while empowering specialized studios to reach their ideal customers.

**4. Unique Selling Proposition (USP):**
**"Book What You Love, When You Want It. Discover Local Fitness Uncomplicated."**

**5. Key Features & Functionalities:**

*   **Discovery Features:**
    *   **Hyper-Local & Interest-Based Filtering:** Proximity-first search, "Vibe" and "Intensity" tags, "Try Something New" recommendations, visual discovery feed.
    *   **Niche Studio Spotlight:** Studio "Story" profiles, curated collections (e.g., "Best for Core Strength," "Mindfulness Focus").

*   **Booking Transparency & Simplicity:**
    *   **Clear Per-Class Pricing & Inclusions:** No subscription lock-in, actual prices shown, breakdown of what's included.
    *   **Seamless Booking Flow:** One-click booking (post-profile setup), integrated calendar sync, guest booking option.
    *   **Real-Time Availability:** Dynamic updating of open spots.

*   **Studio Onboarding & Management:**
    *   **Simple, Intuitive Dashboard:** Drag-and-drop schedule management, automated roster management, integrated payment processing.
    *   **Empowerment Tools for Niche Studios:** Customizable studio profiles, optional direct messaging, promotional tools (introductory discounts).

*   **User Experience (UX) & Engagement:**
    *   **Clean & Modern Interface:** Intuitive navigation, visually appealing class cards.
    *   **Post-Class Engagement:** Quick rating and review system, "Favorite" studios/classes feature, personalized "What's Next" suggestions.

**Next Steps (Potential - Requires Technical Roles):**
The next phase would involve translating these features into detailed technical specifications, including technology stack selection, database design, API development, and UI/UX wireframing and prototyping. Given the current team composition, these technical aspects cannot be addressed.

This forms the current state of the project blueprint, based on market analysis and feature definition.
